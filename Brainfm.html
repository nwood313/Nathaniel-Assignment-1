          <p class="headline-4">Patented Technology</p>
          <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit strong neural phase locking—allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity—and technology to remove distraction in sound. This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we’ve found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

          <p class="headline-4">Tested on Brain and Behavior</p>
          <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments. We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
          <p><strong>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo') of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</strong></p>
