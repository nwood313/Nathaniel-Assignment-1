          <p class="headline-2">Patented Technology</p>
          <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, 
            including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking</strong>—allowing populations
            of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity—and technology to
            remove distraction in sound.</p> 
            <p> This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. 
            In other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

          <p class="headline-2">Tested on Brain and Behavior</p>
          <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.</p>
          <p> We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run 
            large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
          <p><strong> Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</strong>
            of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech
            is what makes the difference.</strong></p>
